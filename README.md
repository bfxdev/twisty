# Twisty puzzles - Collection of documents and code

This repository gathers some stuff I developed mainly for the 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, and in general for Twisty Puzzles:

- List of turn sequences using an [alternative "Pronounceable" notation](personal-documentation/Layer-by-layer-3x3x3-alternative-pronounceable-notation.pdf) for the classical beginner solution (layer-by-layer) of the 3x3x3 cube
- [EFY](personal-documentation/EFY-Edge-First-Y-method-for-the-3x3x3-cube.pdf) - Edge-First method largely inspired by Less-is-More or the original Philip Marshall methods, using only one turn sequence
- An [alternative description/notation](personal-documentation/Rotation-Permutation-Puzzle-Model.txt) of the current state of a generic Twisty Puzzle, based on the position of each piece related to each rotation surface - Unfinished
- An [attempt to find 3x3x3 turn sequences](old/brute-force-algos.py) that leave a certain number of pieces untouched by brute-force  in Python
