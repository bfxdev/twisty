## Expected features

## WCA Notation

From https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#12a

12a) Notation for NxNxN Cubes:

12a1) Face Moves (outer slice):
12a1a) Clockwise, 90 degrees: F (front face), B (back face), R (right face), L (left face), U (upper face), D (bottom face).
12a1b) Counter-clockwise, 90 degrees: F', B', R', L', U', D'.
12a1c) 180 degrees: F2, B2, R2, L2, U2, D2.

12a2) Outer Block Moves (outer slice with adjacent inner slices). For each of the moves defined below, n is the total number of slices to move, which must be in the range 1 < n < N (where N is the number of layers in the puzzle). n may also be omitted, for an implicit value of n = 2 slices. Outer Block Moves are:
12a2a) Clockwise, 90 degrees: nFw, nBw, nRw, nLw, nUw, nDw.
12a2b) Counter-clockwise, 90 degrees: nFw', nBw', nRw', nLw', nUw', nDw'.
12a2c) 180 degrees: nFw2, nBw2, nRw2, nLw2, nUw2, nDw2.

12a4) Rotations (entire puzzle):
12a4a) Clockwise, 90 degrees: x (same direction as R or L'), y (same direction as U or D'), z (same direction as F or B').
12a4b) Counter-clockwise, 90 degrees: x' (same direction as R' or L), y' (same direction as U' or D), z' (same direction as F' or B).
12a4c) 180 degrees: x2, y2, z2.

12a5) Outer Block Turn Metric (OBTM) is defined as:
12a5a) Each move of the categories Face Moves and Outer Block Moves is counted as 1 move.
12a5b) Each move of the Rotations category is counted as 0 moves.

12a6) Execution Turn Metric (ETM) is defined as: Each move of the categories Face Moves, Outer Block Moves, and Rotations is counted as 1 move.


12c) Notation for Square-1:

12c1) Moves are applied with one of the two smallest surfaces of the equatorial slice on the left side of the front face.
12c2) (x, y) means: turn upper layer x times 30 degrees clockwise, turn bottom layer y times 30 degrees clockwise. x and y must be integers from -5 to 6, and cannot be both equal to 0.
12c3) "/" means: turn the right half of the puzzle 180 degrees.
12c4) Metric for Square-1: (x, y) counts as one move, "/" counts as one move.


12d) Notation for Megaminx (scrambling notation only):

12d1) Face Moves:
12d1a) Clockwise, 72 degrees: U (upper face).
12d1b) Counter-clockwise, 72 degrees: U' (upper face).
12d2) Other moves are applied while keeping 3 pieces fixed at the top left of the puzzle:
12d2c) Clockwise 144 degrees move of the whole puzzle except for the slice of top left three pieces: R++ (vertical slices), D++ (horizontal slices).
12d2d) Counter-clockwise 144 degrees move of the whole puzzle except for the slice of top left three pieces: R-- (vertical slices), D-- (horizontal slices).


12e) Notation for Pyraminx:
12e1) The puzzle is oriented with the bottom face completely horizontal and the front face facing the person who is holding the Pyraminx.
12e2) Clockwise, 120 degrees: U (upper 2 layers), L (left 2 layers), R (right 2 layers), B (back 2 layers), u (upper vertex), l (left vertex), r (right vertex), b (back vertex).
12e3) Counter-clockwise, 120 degrees: U' (upper 2 layers), L' (left 2 layers), R' (right 2 layers), B' (back 2 layers), u' (upper vertex), l' (left vertex), r' (right vertex), b' (back vertex).


12g) Notation for Clock:
12g1) The puzzle is oriented with 12 o'clock on top, and either side in front.
12g2) Move pins up: UR (top-right), DR (bottom-right), DL (bottom-left), UL (top-left), U (both top), R (both right), D (both bottom), L (both left), ALL (all).
12g3) Turn a wheel next to an up-position pin and move all pins down afterwards: x+ (x clockwise turns), x- (x counter-clockwise turns).
12g4) Turn around the puzzle so that 12 o'clock stays on top, and then move all pins down: y2.


12h) Notation for Skewb:
12h1) The puzzle is oriented with three faces fully visible, where the upper face is on top.
12h2) Clockwise, 120 degrees: R (the layer around the farthest visible bottom-right vertex), U (the layer around the farthest visible upper vertex), L (the layer around the farthest visible bottom-left vertex), B (the layer around the farthest non-visible back vertex).
12h3) Counter-clockwise, 120 degrees: R' (the layer around the farthest visible bottom-right vertex), U' (the layer around the farthest visible upper vertex), L' (the layer around the farthest visible bottom-left vertex), B' (the layer around the farthest non-visible back vertex).
