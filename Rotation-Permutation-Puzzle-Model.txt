Definition of Rotation Permutation Puzzle
-----------------------------------------

Rotation Permutation Puzzle defined as such:
 - One solid object
 - Set of rotation surfaces, defined by an oriented axis and a revolution surface around this axis
 - Each revolution surface cuts the object in two parts, each part being able to turn relative to the other around the related axis
 - The object is partitioned into different pieces by the set of n rotation surfaces, with a maximum of 2^n different pieces
 - If a subset of k surfaces do not intersect (e.g. parallel planes), the surfaces cut the object into k+1 sub-blocks (not 2^k)
    hence reducing the number of resulting pieces      
 - The set of rotation surfaces contain tuples of 3 surfaces (A,B,C) such that B equals globally C (i.e. C or C inverted for a plane)
    after rotation around the axis of A (angle less than 2*PI)
 - There is a finite number of possible rotation angles for each axis 

Example of the 2x2x2 cube:
 - Primary object is a cube
 - Three rotation surfaces: planes through (0,0,0) in X, Y and Z directions named respectively R, T and F
 - All surfaces are intersecting, hence maximum number of 2^3=8 pieces is reached
 - Rotation around X plane anti-clockwise cycles surfaces as following: Y -> Z -> Y inv -> Z inv -> Y 


Example of the 3x3x3 cube:
 - 6 rotation surfaces, one in each directions: X, -X, Y, -Y, Z, -Z
 - 3 subsets of 2 non-intersecting surfaces: (X, -X), (Y, -Y), (Z, -Z)  
 - Upper bound of number of pieces based on number of surfaces: 2^6 = 64
 - Real number of pieces reflecting non-intersecting surfaces, i.e. 3 subsets of k=2 surfaces: (k+1)*(k+1)*(k+1) = 3*3*3 = 27
 - Number of visible pieces (all except central piece): 26
 

Pronounceable Notation 
---------------------

One or more letter for each rotation surface: Top, Down, Right, Left, Front, Back, Back-Left (BL), etc

One specific letter for rotation direction:
 - E: clockwise
 - A: anti-clockwise

Zero or one specific letter:
 - Nothing: regular rotation, i.e. turn all pieces above rotation surface
 - U: turn Under, i.e. turn all pieces below rotation surface
 - O: blOck turn, i.e. turn all pieces together around axis of rotation surface
 - I: slIce turn, i.e. turn pieces above rotation surface and below next rotation surface 

Example moves for 3x3x3:
 - Simple SAM: RE TA RA TE
 - Cycle 3 corners on upper layer: RA TE LE TA RE TE LA TA
 - Cycle 3 edges on upper layer: RE TE RA TE RE TE TE RA



Position Matrix Notation
------------------------

The state of a puzzle with n rotation surfaces and m pieces can be represented by one matrix such that:
 - m columns, one for each existing piece
 - n lines representing the sign of the position of each piece relative to surface, 0 if over surface, 1 under surface

For a 2x2x2 cube, the position matrix can be represented as following:

 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111

| 0   0   0   0   1   1   1   1 |    X       
| 0   0   1   1   0   0   1   1 |    Y
| 0   1   0   1   0   1   0   1 |    Z

The matrix can be noted in a compact way as a bit map, writing each column as a bits sequence:

  01234567
 ----------
| 00001111 | X
| 00110011 | Y
| 01010101 | Z
 ----------

Each slice of the 2x2x2 cube can be represented as such:

    X >
    ^ y
    |
 10 | 00  x  ^
----+----->  Y
 11 | 01
    |


For most puzzles, (e.g. with non-intersecting surfaces), not all columns are used. Some combinations are
 not possible with non-intersecting surfaces, e.g. a piece cannot be located above 2 parallel planes at the same
 time i.e. the bits sequence 00 is not possible. Some pieces are not visible.

For the 3x3x3 cube, we start with the full list of positions not taking non-intersecting surfaces into
 account with marked real pieces ("#"), i.e. where relative position of 2 consecutive surfaces are not 00 (marked as "+")

Rotations with the position matrix
----------------------------------

Rotations are identified by the tuples of related rotation surfaces. Around the axis of each surface,
  a surface is transformed into another one, possibly with inversion. Each surface is oriented.

For the 2x2x2 cube, represented with anti-clockwise turn around X:

        ^
        | Y
     +--|-+----+
    /   |/    /| 
   +----+----+0|
  /    /    /|1+       /\
 +----+----+0|/|  X   |  
 |    |    |0+1-----> |  ^
 |    |    |/|1+      |  |
 +----+----+1|/        \/
 |   /|    |0+
 |  / |    |/
 +-/--+----+
  / Z
 L


The tuples for anti-clockwise rotations can be described as:
 - Around X: Y -> Z -> -Y -> -Z -> Y
 - Around Y: Z -> X -> -Z -> -X -> Z
 - Around Z: X -> Y -> -X -> -Y -> X

For clockwise rotations, the sequence of surfaces can be obtained by reversing the sequences defined for anti-clockwise.

In order to simplify the notation, the surfaces are referenced by their index from 1 to n.

A rotation around the surface of index a, with additional surfaces in the tuples of index s1..sk, can be defined as such:
 - Impact only on pieces for which the bit at index a is 0
 - Impacted pieces keep their bit at index a to 0
 - If all surfaces are intersecting at origin, bits are swapped according to a Gray code
 

Around a: s1 -> s2 -> (-) s1 -> (-) s2 -> s1

| 0   0   1   1  |    Y s1 
| 0   1   0   1  |    Z s2

| 1   0   1   0  |    Y s1
| 0   0   1   1  |    Z s2


 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
 -------------------------------
| X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X |    X
| 0   0   1   1   X   X   X   X |    Y
| 0   1   0   1   X   X   X   X |    Z

              |
              V

| X   X   X   X   X   X   X   X |    X
| 1   0   1   0   X   X   X   X |    Y
| 0   0   1   1   X   X   X   X |    Z

Rotations can be represented as permutations of numbers, recognized by their values, each number representing a piece.

For example with 2x2x2 cube:
 - Rotation RA (X anti-clockwise): 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2
 - 4 x RA: 01234567 -> 13024567 -> 32104567 -> 20314567 -> 01234567
